# Personal Site V2
This is the second version of my site that is meant to display my work

Now if you're someone who has seen this before, you might be asking "why are you making a second version?"

Truth is...I kinda rushed the learning process of front end development. So much so that my foundations were extremely shakey.

This doesn't mean my code is necessarily bad, but I know I can do so much better and in a way that would produce an end result that I'm happy with.

Basically, I overengineered and it hurt my brain, realized I coulda just done it with the basics no problem.
